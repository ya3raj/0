/**
 * Unified interactive chat console — engine-side turn driver.
 *
 * This is the conversational front-end for the 0 engine described in the
 * 0 "operator cockpit" direction: one surface where an operator talks to the
 * engine and it can invoke every tool in the registry (recon, web pentest,
 * source-scan, variant-hunt, verify, patch-gen) in one place.
 *
 * It deliberately REUSES the engine's real components rather than re-building
 * them:
 *   - the real tool registry + dispatcher (`getToolsForRole` + `ToolExecutor`
 *     from `agent/tools.ts`),
 *   - the real LLM runtime (`LlmApiRuntime.executeNative` from
 *     `runtime/llm-api.ts`, the same native tool_use client the autonomous
 *     `runNativeAgentLoop` drives).
 *
 * What it adds is the thin turn-orchestration glue that `runNativeAgentLoop`
 * intentionally does NOT expose: a chat turn that runs the model + its tool
 * calls to a natural stop and then HANDS CONTROL BACK to the operator, keeping
 * the conversation history across operator turns. `runNativeAgentLoop` is a
 * one-shot autonomous scan (it terminates the whole run when the model calls
 * `done`), so its terminal semantics don't fit a "respond, then wait for me"
 * console. The inner turn cycle here mirrors that loop's cycle (executeNative →
 * dispatch tool_use via ToolExecutor → append tool_result → repeat) so the two
 * stay behaviourally aligned. See `console/repl.ts` for the CLI consumer.
 *
 * The session now supports in-memory, operator-approved scope expansion and
 * per-tool approval for the interactive surface. It never writes a scope file;
 * normal autonomous scan enforcement remains outside this console-specific
 * layer.

/**
 * Operator engagement mode for the console. This is a FRICTION model, not an
 * authorization-removal model: the current TARGET is the authorization anchor in
 * every mode, and the executor's own target/scope boundary plus the absolute
 * SSRF/private-network rail run underneath all three regardless of mode.
 *
 * - `"standard"`: the MOST-PROMPTING mode. Every effectful
 *   (non-read-only) action is put to the operator via `approveTool` before it
 *   runs and is dispatched only on an explicit yes — approval is never assumed.
 *   Out-of-scope network targets still go through scope-on-demand
 *   (`requestScope`), and uncovered local paths through `requestLocalScope`.
 * - `"copilot"`: full autonomy WITHIN the engagement. No per-action prompts.
 *   Scope-on-demand is AUTO-APPROVED for newly-discovered targets that belong
 *   to the engagement (the current target's host / its sub-domains, or paths
 *   adjacent to an established local scope) — the scope grows without asking,
 *   and the expansion is recorded. A target OUTSIDE the established engagement
 *   is not auto-authorized: it defers to the operator (`requestScope`) or, with
 *   no approval channel, is refused. Copilot only ever operates against the
 *   target/scope the operator established.
 * - `"yolo"` (default): no per-action prompts or preconfigured scope required.
 *   Target-related hosts and local paths are authorized automatically. A new
 *   unrelated network target asks the operator through `requestScope`; without
 *   an approval channel it is refused. Explicit exclusions, denied-decision
 *   memory, dangerous-local-root restrictions and SSRF protections remain.
 * - `"recon"`: passive, in-scope reconnaissance — the MOST capability-restricted
 *   mode. For AUTHORIZATION it behaves like standard: it operates strictly
 *   within the configured scope / target anchor and NEVER auto-expands scope
 *   (out-of-anchor targets are prompted via `requestScope`, or fall through to
 *   the executor's same-origin validation — never silently widened). For
 *   CAPABILITY it is stricter than any other mode: only non-exploitative work is
 *   permitted — read-only tools plus a conservative set of passive network-recon
 *   tools (see {@link RECON_PASSIVE_NETWORK_TOOLS}). Every effectful / mutating /
 *   exploitation tool (apply_patch, run_command, browser, exploit-class
 *   scanners, spawn_agent, raw http_request, …) is REFUSED with a clear reason —
 *   never prompted, never auto-lifted. Because it never runs effectful tools,
 *   recon does not use the per-action approval prompt at all. The target anchor
 *   and the absolute SSRF rail still bound the passive tools it does allow.

   *   - before the FIRST model call (already-aborted signal ⇒ immediate return,
   *     no model call, no history mutation);
   *   - between rounds / before issuing the NEXT model call;
   *   - before dispatching each tool in a round.
   *
   * WHAT IT CANNOT INTERRUPT — stated plainly so no one is misled:
   *   - a tool already executing. Same-process JavaScript cannot be hard-
   *     killed; a tool in `executor.execute(...)` runs to completion and the
   *     signal takes effect only at the NEXT checkpoint (the next tool, or the
   *     next round).
   *   - an OAuth token refresh already in flight. `executeNative` now takes
   *     the signal and aborts an in-flight model call, but a ChatGPT/Codex
   *     token refresh issued inside `ensureFreshHeaders` takes no signal, so
   *     an abort during that one refresh waits it out — the model fetch then
   *     aborts immediately and the pre-attempt guard stops any retry.
   *
   * An in-flight MODEL call IS interruptible: the runtime composes the
   * operator signal with its own timeout and idle watchdog, and reports the
   * result structurally via `cancelled` so a cancellation is never mistaken
   * for a transport failure. A cancelled call is also never retried and never
   * fails over to another provider — retrying a request the operator just
   * cancelled would defeat the cancellation.
   *
   * CONVERSATION INTEGRITY is preserved regardless of when the signal fires:
   * if it fires mid-round after tool calls were already dispatched, every
   * outstanding `tool_use` still receives a matching `tool_result` (a synthetic
   * "cancelled by operator" result) before the turn returns, so history is
   * never left with an unmatched `tool_use` and the next `send()` resumes
   * cleanly. Cancelling a turn NEVER clears or bypasses authorization state —
   * denied-host / denied-path memory and granted scope are untouched.

// ── Target extraction from tool arguments ──
//
// HONEST LIMIT — READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING ANYTHING BELOW.
//
// A regex (or a hand-rolled tokenizer) over a shell command CANNOT be a
// security boundary, and this code does not pretend to be one. A shell command
// is a program in a Turing-complete language whose destination is decided at
// RUNTIME, not at parse time. Every one of these defeats the extractor below,
// trivially and by design of the shell, not by a bug here:
//
//   H=evil.example; curl "$H"          — variable indirection
//   curl $(cat /tmp/h)                 — command substitution
//   echo Y3VybCBldmls | base64 -d | sh — encoded payload piped to a shell
//   python3 -c 'import socket; ...'    — any interpreter with a socket API
//   curl -K /tmp/cfg                   — destination read from a config file
//   ./fetch.sh                         — a script whose contents we never see
//   printf '\\x63url evil.example' | sh — escaped/obfuscated program name
//
// The extractor is defence in depth, not an egress sandbox. Standard/copilot
// escalate unresolved shell destinations. YOLO permits opaque local commands,
// but named unrelated hosts still require an operator scope decision.
//
// Real enforcement, if it is ever wanted, has to happen where the syscalls
// happen: a network namespace, a filtering proxy the tools are forced through,
// or a seccomp/LSM policy. None of that is in this file.

/**

   *   - `guardApprovalUnavailable` (standard-mode): standard is now the mode
   *     that requires per-action approval, so this guard closes that gate's
   *     fail-OPEN corner — in standard mode a non-read-only tool with no
   *     approval mechanism is denied rather than run unapproved. It is inert in
   *     copilot/yolo (prompt-free by design) and in recon (whose capability gate
   *     refuses effectful tools before this floor is ever reached).
   * The deny-only pattern is preserved intact — "allow" remains inexpressible,
   * and adding guards can only narrow access.
   *
   * The THIRD built-in, `guardNetworkRequiresScope`, is DELIBERATELY NOT wired:
   * it is retired. Console YOLO now explicitly opts into public-network access;
   * optional operator restrictions, denied decisions and private-network
   * boundaries remain enforced by the console, executor and pinned transport.
   * Existing non-console callers retain their target/same-origin policy.
   * Wiring it would wrongly re-deny scopeless yolo (even `bash echo hello`). The
   * function still exists and is exported from `plugins/guards.ts` for its own
   * unit tests and any other consumer; only the wired sets omit it.
